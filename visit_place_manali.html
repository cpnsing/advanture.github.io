                <p>Also known by the names Hidimba Devi Temple and Dhungari Temple, this ancient shrine was built by Maharaja Bahadur Singh way back in 1553. As the name suggests, the temple is dedicated to Hidimba Devi, wife of Bheema. The wooden architecture of the shrine is very distinct from most Hindu temples you will come across in the country. There’s another shrine dedicated to Hidimba Devi’ son Ghatotkacha in the premises. Surrounded by thick cedar groves and with snow-capped mountains serving as the backdrop, the temple is one of the best places to visit in Manali.</p>

                <p>A mini valley located at about 8400 feet above sea level, Solang Nala is a short drive away from Manali. It is a haven for adventure and sports lovers and while here, you can try your skills on a pair of skis or go for a snowmobile exploration. When the weather warms up, people flock here for zorbing and paragliding. You can also hop onto a cable car and enjoy mesmerizing views of the Himalayas. If you are looking for snow-based activities and sports, winters are the best time to visit while the months of summer are ideal for other adventure sports.</p>

                <p>The ornate design and the quintessential Tibetan architecture make the Gadhan Thekchhokling Gompa, more commonly referred to as the Manali Gompa, one of the finest landmarks in Manali. Built by Tibetan refugees in the 1960s, this monastery allows you to enjoy quiet settings and unmatched spiritual vibes.  Some of the key highlights of the Manali Gompa include exquisite murals that depict important events of Buddhism in vivid colors and roofs built in the Pagoda style. The stalls in the complex are a good place to pick up some souvenirs and Tibetan handicraft items.</p>

                <p>Take a moment and think of postcard-perfect alpine meadows and evergreen tree forests near a serene high-altitude water body. Well, you have just now pictured Bhrigu Lake, one of the best trekking destinations around Manali. A bit of acclimatization is needed if you are going for the trek as the lake is located more than 4000 meters above sea level. The scenery and panoramic views of the Pir Panjal Range are what draws most visitors to this place.</p>
